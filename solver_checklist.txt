- benchmarker (without GUI, run X times, show run statistics)
- fix the row, column or non square grid solving
- add more degrees of freedom if guess for no bomb is uncertain (add cells not next to numbers to the unknowns, might need to add every unknown cell to have a well posed equation)
	- figure out ways to add new equations than just using the 	current revealed numbers
- get constrained solve working
- make gui for next move guess
- add colour strings to printing for pretty debugging
