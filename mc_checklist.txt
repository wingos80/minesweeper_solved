BENCHMARK- 15 cases (3 maps by 5 densities), 100 runs each:

SEEDS = np.arange(0,100)
BOARD_SIZE = [(8,8), (16,16), (64,64)]
BOMB_DENSITY = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]
metrics = success_rate, number of (un)explored cells upon game end, runtime till game end, ratio of correct to incorrect flag placements

run the benchmark for
- whatever solver we have now
- abs() before using argmin() to select next move
- solver with full rule
- solver using nnls
- solver using linear_lsq
